# Alexandria
The Alexandria tool exists to aid in the building, use, and preservation of personal reference libraries. 

Within Alexandria are two main initiatives: Library and Lighthouse. The project's name comes from historical inspiration, with the Library of Alexandria being one of the greatest lost stores of ancient knowledge in history, and the Lighthouse of Alexandria being one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, which are all now, save for the Pyramids of Giza, lost. 

Library contains tools for building a directory system of simple text files containing knowledge on any topic a user desires. The first use of Alexandria is taking simplistic notes in text files known as your Stacks. These notes are then consumed by a program which turns the notes into a personal wiki of static HTML pages known as your Catalog. These pages can be posted to a static HTML hosting environment such as GitHub pages, a private hosting solution, or kept on your local machine for reference. Additionally, you can reference your notes using a command-line interface, either by glancing at a blurb in summary, reading an entire file, or asking a question on a subject or process. When viewed in wiki format, the purpose of your Library is to be a complete and concise knowledge store on the subject in question, built upon a framework of related ideas that you can reference without leaving the page. When used via CLI, whether in a shell or embedded within an IDE, your Library is meant to be an easy reference that keeps you from leaving your work-environment and hopefully aids in maintaining focus and productivity.

Lighthouse is geared towards the preservation of your personal library, and is currently in the planning stages.

In all efforts, Alexandria seeks to use minimal external references or non-standard technologies.
